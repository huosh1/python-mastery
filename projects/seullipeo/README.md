# Seullipeo

Seullipeo (슬리퍼) is a modular, extensible offensive framework for local privilege escalation and enumeration automation. Designed for Red Teamers and learners rising through the Sleeper ranks, it combines scanning, exploit triggering, and structured reporting.

Current phase: early sleeper development — basic privilege escalation techniques and cron/SUID modules.
